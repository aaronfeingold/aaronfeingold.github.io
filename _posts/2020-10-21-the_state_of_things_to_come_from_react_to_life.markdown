So you, my valued reader, must really be wondering by now: when is he going to tell us more about his Flatiron journey, and what are his career plans after the course is completed? Glad you asked!

The plans for the future look a lot like the plans at present, with a couple minor adjustments.

Or you could say { ...state, plans: updatedPlans } 

Lots of continuous learning and implementing. And improvising. And updating knowledge. But mostly, a lot of mainting state.

Learning to code from a place of scarcity of basic computer know-how, I've gotta say: I'm pretty impressed with myself. The earliest CLI project had my brain falling to mush. And now I'm confident that I could bang out a sweet React app in no time flat. 

Getting a solid understanding of props and state in Redux--essentially, how to send/manipulate info from parent to child between an entire app of many different files--took longer than the few weeks of this section of the course, and really didn't start to piece together in my mind until the end of final-project week, when many lighbulbs suddenly went on. 

My advice: Keep It Simple. And don't get too caught up in the semantics; just because your code isn't as complicated-looking as some of your peers doesn't mean it can't still do powerful things.

It really took having to work on my own project to solidfy a basic understanding of how this particular framework makes coding a very fluid experience. It can't be stated enough how important getting experience is, and its excellent that Flatiron offers the impetus and structure by which to hold yourself. Reading, watching a few videos: that's the tip of the ice-berg of knowledge when it comes to what this framework is capable of. There are lots of ins-and-outs, little things turning-and-burning on each page, making magic happen, and confidently knowing how your code controls that takes more than a few days of studying: it takes experience.

I want more experience with this framework, and to be given new problems to solve. Once you start to know what kinds of problems typically occur, you can really begin to account for the time needed to research and debug. Then the potential starts to unfold. I can almost right now visualize the power of the applications that can be derived from working in React, only I lack the experience to make those ideas a reality today, to bring to life the many ideas floating in my heard. So many cool things can be built with this. Just a matter of time. Its hard to make up my own problems for myself unless I really keep trying to make this particular first app do more things. Its actually pretty fun when someone else passes the responsibility to craft a plausible solution to a seemingly impassable problem--it gives me a moment to really get my brain rolling, and lots of satisfaction when the 'ah-ha' moments start to unfold.

My project doesn't look much more complex from my previous JavaScript SPA. But after comparing the source code for the two, its very cool to see how React-Redux actually makes life so much more clear, organized, and streamlined. Its high-level coding made easy, and what it can create is really just a matter of the developers commitment to innovation. And that's the crux of this project for me.

What's some context on this 'project' ? I sought to make a mock-up model of a meal-delivery app. Essentially, the idea is that very many people can be in their homes right now with not much to do, but they at least have a fridge, knife, cutting board, and some tupperware. Then, couldn't they be chopping up meals to prep for themselves or, even better, for others for money? This app was my way to start looking into the idea of how to get many people to organize community meal prepparation for enfranchisement and also civic empowerment. I believe many answers to solving real world problems live hidden in the tech already available. 

React is a very powerful tool, and once you get the hang of it, rolling out new features into the app is easier and easier. So as the project is, its complete, but I've got many ideas of how to build from here. I intend to make it a showcase of all the little things I learn along the way, for however long that may be. In the meantime, catch me on the flipside to see where I land in the next few weeks.
