> "Routes rate me, not the other way around." â€” Andy Cairns

Working with Restful routing and CRUD with Sinatra and Active Record has been challenging for me. Enough so, I actually had one of those moments of "maybe I *am* in over my head". It felt like once a problem had been fixed, another was then created. 

But with enough fiddling around, I was eventually able to predict the effects of one change, and track how that would play out. I slowly began to understand how routing worked, how information moved between controllers, models, and views. The routes challenged me to be precise and alert, and I approached them through piecemeal changes. With my two-steps-forward-one-step-back approach, it took a lot longer than I had expected to complete the work. Yet, it revealed many 'ah-ha' moments. Although the app is ultimately far from what I had hoped it would be, it is still satisfying seeing that it functions as intended.

The biggest take-away from the experience is that the process of web-app coding isn't streamlined. It is very often an ebb-and-flow cycle, which can be exciting at times, but also disorienting if you don't pay attention. Getting through this challenge has given me hope that while there is going to continue to be a lot of new info coming my way, these skills are going to build on one another so-much-so that I won't be even believe where I had started from.
