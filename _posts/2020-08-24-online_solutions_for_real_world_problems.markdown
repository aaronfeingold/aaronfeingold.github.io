Preplanning is a sort of a continual process. Before you make a good plan, you've gotta plan out the planning session. Now I know that sounds silly and trite, but it happens to be effective, time and time again. What this really allows for, is having the flexibility to "replan", because in trying to do something you've never done before, its hard to know exactly what problems you will run into along the way, and you may need to go back to the drawing board. This can slow things down, but if you account for it from the beginning, you can still stay on pace.

That being said, staying on pace is still not easy, especially when it comes to constructing a design in a discipline thats still new to you. 

Maybe you're thinking I'm complaining about coding now. I'm not--ok maybe just a little. Instead I'm trying to bring up the frustrations that lots of people deal with in business in general.  One of the biggest frustrations is wasted time. And often when you build something, and it doesnt get sold, it becomes a physical symbol of wasted time. Which means, its time to figure out how to get it sold and make some money--so long as the product hasn't decayed...

For my project, I sought to create a system for a winery to make use of idle juice. Demand for alcohol will stay strong during the pandemic, but making new product will become more difficult with labor shortages and wildfires. Yet, wineries are hoarding juice for such an occasion--thats the nice thing about a product that gets better with time. So if we look to all the wine in barrel (wood, ceramic, stainless steel, etc.), we'll find that there's lots of wine to be sold, but often wineries don't have very consistent records of what is where. Its like a rainy day project for the winery: go through all the wine that we have forgot is just sitting in barrel and let's get it bottled. People can't drink it till we bottle it, of course. This app is basically an inventory report for all the unbottled barrels of wine a winery is holding--I bet some small wineries would be amazed at the value of their overlooked, liquidable assets. 

I don't really have much advice to give about getting a rails project complete. Its actually pretty straightforward. The only thing I would say is don't get frustrated if you find you need to gut a project and rework the model relationships over again a few times. Getting that part of the design set-up well is perhaps the most important part of the process. Otherwise, enjoy the fun of debugging!
