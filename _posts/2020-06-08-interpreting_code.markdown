This may not be something you'd want to tell a group of adults at a cocktail party, but I admit it: sometimes, I like to read my books out loud--not for the entire chapter, just a page, or paragraph, or a run-on sentance. Maybe, if the characters are having a conversation, I'll give their voices each their own timbre and cadence. Its like my own personal book-on-tape, if only for an instance. And it gives the story a little more life. It can make reading perhaps more fun. Although, most importantly, hearing the words helps me to understand, concentrate, and to also appreciate the artform itself. 

The sound of a language can animate and give purpose to a typed print. Sounding out every syllable digs into the orgin of the syntax, and creates a reminder of how we've come to interpret, echo, and recognize our shared realities.

By putting a voice to software code in the language that best suits you, that precisely suits you, can open up the door(s?) to translating the real world into the world where software exits. Like slowly finger-picking on a guitar, or swiftly slashing paint from the brush's tip against the canvass whilst standing from a distance: it is an expression of an unique idea from within, and it needs its own method to be seen, heard, felt, or simply acknowledged. I'm finding momentously, that as I more thoroughly explain myself, speaking out loud in the silence of my home, I come to find with intention--and despite all the reduncacies--what function(s) it is that my code is creating along with me.

Do I know right now exactly what uses I will find from simply learning the various languages used in software engineering? No, I'm a complete novice, and I can barely see how all this comes together to build something like Google Earth. And I bring that up for a reason: on a personal note, when I came across that website when I was a kid, it changed my life. After homework and dinner, I would spend hours--literally hours--scoping out places near my home like NYC, learning every back street and hidden spot to park without having to pay a meter; Harriman state park, and discovering where trails would lead; Napa Valley vineyards, imagining I was a winemaker choosing the best grapes. Even today, I plan my backpacking and climbing adventures with it, searching for any sort of sign that'll guide me. How the designers and engineers behind that program saw the literal world and translated back to myself and anyone else using the program was not simply innovative: it was life changing. 

And if I can use the language of code, maybe I can really make some change and help someone. That's the ultimately the goal of this.


*Hope you liked this first blog. It doesn't really matter much to me if I didn't explain myself well here: its only important if each blog is better than the last. *
